# Test Grade Calculator

## Project Overview
This project calculates and analyzes test scores for multiple classes based on a provided answer key. It processes data files containing student IDs and answers, validates the data, calculates scores, and generates statistical reports.

## Files
- `agent_jules_grade_the_exams.py`: The main Python script.
- `class1.txt` to `class8.txt`: Input data files.
- `*_grades.txt`: Output files generated by the script.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy

To install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

## How to Run
Run the script from the command line:
```bash
python3 agent_jules_grade_the_exams.py
```

Follow the prompt to enter a class file name (e.g., `class1` or `class1.txt`). The program will:
1.  Open and validate the file.
2.  Report any invalid lines.
3.  Calculate scores and statistics (Mean, Highest, Lowest, Range, Median).
4.  Generate a results file (e.g., `class1_grades.txt`) with `ID,Score`.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Loading**: Uses `pandas.read_csv` to load data efficiently.
- **Validation**:
    - Checks for exactly 26 values per line (ID + 25 Answers).
    - Validates Student ID format (`N` followed by 8 digits).
- **Scoring**:
    - +4 points for correct answers.
    - 0 points for skipped answers.
    - -1 point for incorrect answers.
- **Statistics**: Calculates Mean, Max, Min, Range, and Median.
    - Median formatting: displayed as integer if the number of valid students is odd, otherwise as a float.
